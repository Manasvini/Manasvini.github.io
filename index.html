        <p> I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Embedded Pervasive Lab led by Dr. Kishore Ramachandran at Georgia Tech School of Computer Science. I am on the job market.<br/> 
        My interests lie in distributed systems, internet measurement, and edge computing. In my spare time, I like to draw, read, learn new languages (human ones), and wander around whichever city I'm in. Lately I've been learning Japanese and I've been finding Kanji to be mindblowingly amazing.
