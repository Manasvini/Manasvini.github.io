<p> I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Embedded Pervasive Lab led by Dr. Kishore Ramachandran at Georgia Tech School of Computer Science.<br/> 
My interests lie in distributed systems, internet measurement, and edge computing. In my spare time, I like to draw, read, learn new languages (human ones), and wander around the city.
