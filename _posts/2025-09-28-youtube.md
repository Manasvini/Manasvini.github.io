title: YouTube as a Resource - French Edition
---

YouTube is probably the only social media platform I spend any time on, and a good chunk of my content consumption is related to language learning. As an aid for comprehensible input, YouTube is truly wonderful---the only catch being that the viewer is required to do the work of figuring out what sort of content they want, before the algorithm can start recommending more relevant content. It's almost like "choose your own adventure", and it's up to you to feed it what you think is comprehensible input. This is where Reddit shines---thousands of language learners post useful resources. [r/French](https://www.reddit.com/r/French/) already has figured out some of the best YouTube resources for language learning, so it's a good place to start, for finding channels to seed the YouTube recommendation algorithm.
   
For French, I started out by listening to [Inner French](https://www.youtube.com/innerFrench), which is extremely popular with intermediate learners, as the number of recommendations on Reddit seem to suggest. Needless to say, Hugo Cotton produces high quality content about a variety of subjects, provides a ton of cultural context, as well as current debates in France. Inner French is also available as a [podcast](https://innerfrench.com/category/podcast/) on various platforms, releasing new episodes ~biweekly. 
  
InnerFrench is great, but I quickly ran out of things to listen to, and I'm not always (rare, but still happens) interested in the topic of the episode, so I looked to diversify my feed. r/French immediately had answers in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/6afoh4/comment/dhekh8h/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/fk3624/the_big_list_of_transcribed_podcasts_and/) post. From there, I found [Nota Bene](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP46_MXP_WG_auH88FnfS1A), a science/history/food channel, also available as a podcast. This is clearly not a language learning channel, so the speech is at native speaker level. Nevertheless, as my Prof likes to repeat time and again (I've paraphrased): "your goal shouldn't be to comprehend everything, you're not going to understand much, if you do that. Just listen calmly and try to follow along". It's probably one of the best pieces of language learning advice I've received. Admittedly, I don't understand every word spoken in a given video. However, it's still enough to feel like I learned something new, and also listened to French at the same time. The goal is to understand the content, it just happens to be in French.   

Some channels on etymology, culture and history, that YouTube recommended to me: 
- [Chase in French](https://www.youtube.com/@chaseinfrench/shorts): He makes very good videos on pronunciation, contractions and culture notes, along with some very entertaining reaction videos. 
- [Français avec Nelly](https://www.youtube.com/@francaisavecnelly/videos): Very good for learning, book recommendations, general vocabulary and culture notes. She does collabs with other creators, which are great for listening practice. Also has long form videos explaning grammar points. 
- [Étymocurieux](https://www.youtube.com/@EtymoCurieux): Lots of interesting shorts about word origins.  
- [Vivre au Japon](https://www.youtube.com/@terr.japonn): YouTube somehow figured out how to recommend content by French creators, about Japan (the other language I'm learning)!  
- [Karambolage en français - ARTE](https://www.youtube.com/@karambolagefr): Videos about history, like how Paris arrondissements came to be, history of la bise, etc. 
- [Tokyo no Jo](https://www.youtube.com/@tokyonojo1445): Bilingual in Japanese and French, he makes a ton of content comparing two equally prominent cultures!  

In all, YouTube is a rabbit hole, and it's up to you to decide how to use it! These are just things that worked well for me. 
  
Side note on podcasts: [Little Talk in Slow French](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/little-talk-in-slow-french/id1541856876) by Nagisa Morimoto, as its name implies, is in slow French, covering a variety of subjects. Some of my favorite episodes were about the French Revolution, animal-related expressions (avoir un chat dans la gorge, poser un lapin à quelqu'un, etc), and types of restaurants in France. Nagisa's voice is clear and she often pauses to explain something in English or French. An other, more advanced podcast that I occasionally listen to is [Transfert](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/transfert/id1567870398), where normal people narrate extraordinary stories. It's not always easy to follow, and requires dedicated listening, but is fascinating.
