This project is aimed at enabling equality/social change through computing. The preliminary study is aimed at understanding the current pattern of connectivity that exists today. How does income influence access to Internet? Where do people access the internet(home/public places)? How does access to information affect access to opportunities, employment and healthcare? The idea is to conduct semi-structured interviews with the residents to gain some insights. The answers to these questions are expected to help in co-designing solutions to solve for the information needs of the community, potentially using edge computing based infrastructure.
