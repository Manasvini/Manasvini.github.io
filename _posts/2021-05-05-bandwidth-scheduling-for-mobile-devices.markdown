I'm working with Anirudh Sarma, Profs Ashutosh Dhekne and Kishore Ramchandran to create a bandwidth scheduler on mobile phones that is aware of spatial and temporal variations in bandwidth availability. We create a cloud server that updates bandwidth estimates in real time by location. Then we created an Android service to provide bandwidth schedules for competing applications based on the bandwidth reported in the cloud server.
