Under the guidance of Dr. Ellen Zegura and Dr. Beki Grinter, I'm trying to understandi content production on Wikipedia pertaining to geotagged pages about Indigenous communities.  The project aims to fill the gaps in our understanding about indigenous notions of content creation and if they differ from traditionally Western perspectives of content creation by looking at Wikipedia edits on pages about indigenous communities. For example, are the Wikipedia articles about indigenous communities created and edited by users living on reservations, or outside, or by bots.
