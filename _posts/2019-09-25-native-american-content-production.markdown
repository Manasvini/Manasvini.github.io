The project attempts to understand perspectives and attitudes prevailing in indigenous communities about internet content creation by extracting themes from interviews with the community about their social media use, attitudes towards blogging and content production and their perceptions about privacy on social media. The project also aims to fill the gaps in our understanding about indigenous notions of content creation and if they differ from traditionally Western perspectives of content creation by looking at Wikipedia edits on pages about indigenous communities. For example, are the Wikipedia articles about indigenous communities created and edited by users living on reservations, or outside, or by bots.
