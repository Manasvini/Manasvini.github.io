 I graduated from Georgia Tech in December'24. While I was there, I worked in the Embedded Pervasive Lab led by Dr. Kishore Ramachandran at Georgia Tech School of Computer Science. I am now employed at Google.<br/> 
  
 My interests lie in distributed systems, internet measurement, and edge computing. In my spare time, I like to draw, read, learn new languages (human ones), and wander around whichever city I'm in. Lately I've been learning Japanese and French.    
  
I've been fascinated by languages for a long time now: I bet going to a school run by the central government of India, where you get kids from all over the country had something to do with it. But without speculation, and very concretely, I've been learning Japanese and French for close to two years now. I decided to sit down (after much prodding by my husband), and document some of the process, resources, and just weird/cool things that I encountered.
