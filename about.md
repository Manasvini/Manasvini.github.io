I'm a first year PhD Student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm currently working in the Embedded Pervasive Lab (EPL) on Internet Connectivity in Atlanta. When I'm not in the lab, I can be found either in the CRC, the Atlanta Humane Society or at Dancing Goats. If you can't find me in any of these places, it's probably past 10 PM. 


## Projects  
Here's a brief description of the projects I'm currently working on  
  
### Internet Connectivity in Westside Atlanta  
This project is aimed at enabling equality/social change through computing. The preliminary study is aimed at understanding the current pattern of connectivity that exists today. How does income influence access to Internet? Where do people access the internet(home/public places)? How does access to information affect access to opportunities, employment and healthcare? The idea is to conduct semi-structured interviews with the residents to gain some insights. The answers to these questions are expected to help in co-designing solutions to solve for the information needs of the community, potentially using edge computing based infrastructure.

### Content Production and Consumption in Indigenous Communities  
The project attempts to understand perspectives and attitudes prevailing in indigenous communities about internet content creation by extracting themes from interviews with the community about their social media use, attitudes towards blogging and content production and their perceptions about privacy on social media. The project also aims to fill the gaps in our understanding about indigenous notions of content creation and if they differ from traditionally Western perspectives of content creation by looking at Wikipedia edits on pages about indigenous communities. For example, are the Wikipedia articles about indigenous communities created and edited by users living on reservations, or outside, or by bots.
