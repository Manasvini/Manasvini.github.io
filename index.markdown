I'm a second year PhD Student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm currently working in the Embedded Pervasive Lab (EPL) on a couple of projects, mainly concerned with bandwidth measurements and the role of edge computing in video streaming, under the guidance of Dr. Kishore Ramachandran. When I'm not in the lab, I can be found at home reading or biking. If you can't find me in any of these places, it's probably past 10 PM.
