I'm a first year PhD Student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm currently working in the Embedded Pervasive Lab (EPL) on Internet Connectivity in Atlanta. When I'm not in the lab, I can be found either in the CRC, the Atlanta Humane Society or at Dancing Goats. If you can't find me in any of these places, it's probably past 10 PM.
